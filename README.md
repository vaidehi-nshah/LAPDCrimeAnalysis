### Dated:
Boston University, Fall 2023

### Description:
**DATASET:**

The raw dataset utilized for our analysis is directly sourced from the official government website, data.gov. This platform serves as a centralized repository for a diverse range of datasets, including comprehensive information on crimes committed in Los Angeles. Given its status as a government-endorsed platform, the dataset is considered reliable and authoritative, ensuring that the information stems from official crime reports. The dataset's temporal scope spans from the year 2020 to the present, encompassing crime data up to October 2023. This extensive time frame enables a meticulous examination of crime trends and patterns over a substantial period. The inclusion of data up to the present date facilitates a comprehensive analysis of temporal dynamics in criminal activities within the City of Los Angeles.

**CODE FILE:**

This code is written in PySpark and uses different libraries of Python (like Pandas, Numpy and Folium) as and when needed. The code has the following seggregations: 
1. Data Collection
2. Data Pre-processing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Data Analysis based on Business Problems
5. Machine Learning Models (Random Forest Regressor and Classifier)
